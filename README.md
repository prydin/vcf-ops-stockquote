# VCF Operation SDK example

This is a very simple example of a VCF Operations Management pack based on the VCF Operations SDK. It simply uses a public API to get the bid and ask price of 
a stock that's traded on any of the major US Exchanges. It requires an API key, which can be obtained here: https://finage.co.uk/

In order to build, test and use the Management Pack, you need to install the SDK as described here: https://vmware.github.io/vmware-aria-operations-integration-sdk/introduction/
